# Google Cloud Print CUPS Connector

## Introduction
Share Linux printers and OS X printers with ChromeOS and Android devices, using the CUPS Connector. The CUPS Connector is a purpose-built Unix process, maintained from the command line. It can share hundreds of printers on a powerful server, or one printer on a Raspberry Pi.
